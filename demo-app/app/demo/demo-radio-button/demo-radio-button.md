## Style

* Options should have 16px spacing vertically and horizontally between items

* Do
    * Use radio buttons when scanning options is helpful, helps clarify what's being asked and there is enough space

* Don't
    * Don't include more than 5-7 options, depending on label length use a select menu instead
    * Don't use long labels, consider a heading with an info dialog (for concepts that require additional instruction)

## Content
* Use succinct labels for options rather than sentences
