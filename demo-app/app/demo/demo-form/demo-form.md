## Content
* The form component generally consists of information that will be requested for processing, including employee number,
name, birthday, and other identifying information.

* Form components may also be utilized as a source of processing payments and requests.

* The form component can be nested. This safely allows large model-driven forms to broken up into smaller pieces.
The nested form can be used to build a tree of forms from small components.

## Style

* No stylistic specifications. Forms are containers and are entirely customizable to fit the need of the
content.
