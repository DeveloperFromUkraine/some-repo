## Content

* The empty state is used for pages and elements that do not exist. This includes:
    * Unfinished pages
    * Pages with empty groups or lists.
    * Cards with no content.
* Empty states are the default view for the list-content pattern when there are no items set up; this mainly applies to company settings and other areas that are primarily lists.
* The title and content are configurable and the content may include links (e.g., download a template)
* There are also fixed actions available "Import" and "Add" which display as available, e.g, if import is not available for the area, only add will show.


## Style
* The empty-state component has no stylistic specifications.
