## Use
    The center component is used for aligning other components into the center of the parent element.

    ### Implementation
        - Center can be used for any component.
        - Center is best used for components that are best meant to be in the center of the page without any            surrounding components, as other components may end up on the edges of the parent (see css). 
    
    ### CSS
        - Any CSS related changes (lines, highlighting, etc) will be extended across the parent component as the    window is resized.
