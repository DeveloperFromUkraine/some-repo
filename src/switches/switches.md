# Switches

## Use
Switches (aka slide toggle toggle etc.) are selection controls that instantly take effect... mimicking a physical switches. They allow toggling between mutually exclusive options (e.g. on/off). Like a physical light switch. Use [checkboxes](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=IDS&title=Checkboxes+%28web%29+old&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=108273757) when the effect requires an additional step. see [Material design link](https://material.io/guidelines/components/selection-controls.html#selection-controls-switch) and [Angular Material Slide toggle.](https://material.angular.io/components/slide-toggle/overview) On/off switches toggle the state of a single settings option. The option that the switch controls as well as the state itâ€™s in should be made clear from the corresponding inline label. Switches take on the same visual properties of the radio button.
In code Switches are out of the box Angular Material components. Within Sketch they are presented in horizontal and vertical layouts.
All Selection Controls use Accent color to indicate the selected state.
